To run a YAML script using the ScriptEngine tasks for EC-Earth, use the following command::

    se example_script.yml
    
where ``example_script.yml`` contains tasks from this package.

See ``se --help`` for additional commands such as setting the logging level etc. 

For more info on how to use ScriptEngine in general, read the ScriptEngine_ documentation.
